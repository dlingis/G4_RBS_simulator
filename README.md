# G4_RBS_simulator
A simple code to simulate Rutherford Backscattering Spectra in GEANT4 environment. Still work in progress. 
Relative to Rutherford cross sections can be obtained from SigmaCalc @ http://sigmacalc.iate.obninsk.ru/
And placed in build/RTR_values/Hydrogen(Helium)/H(He)_Al_135.txt . The last number means the scattering angle in lab reference frame.
