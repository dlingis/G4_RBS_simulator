# G4_RBS_simulator
A simple code to simulate Rutherford Backscattering Spectra in GEANT4 environment.
The paper describing the model and the results, as well as references, are here https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2021.108187
Relative to Rutherford cross sections can be obtained from SigmaCalc @ http://sigmacalc.iate.obninsk.ru/
And placed in build/RTR_values/Hydrogen(Helium)/H(He)_Al_135.txt . The last number means the scattering angle in lab reference frame._
